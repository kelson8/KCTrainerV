Instructions
------------

The KCTrainerV/ folder and the compiled KCTrainerV.asi go in the 
root GTA V folder. A KCTrainerV.log is generated on load and some 
actions.  

In the img/ folder, images can be placed which are picked up by the 
`"imagemenu"` submenu. Currently jpg and png images are supported.

I currently have the images disabled until I want to use it later on, they can still be copied to the game folder they just won't do anything right now.
